In conventional citrus breeding programs, hybridization is the main method used for obtaining rootstock varieties.

The female parents were the \u2018Santa Cruz Rangpur\u2019 lime (SCRL) and the \u2018Sunki of Florida\u2019 mandarin (SFM), while the male parents, in addition to this mandarin, were the \u2018Indio\u2019 and \u2018Riverside\u2019 citrandarins, the \u2018Thomasville\u2019 citrangequat (THOM), the \u2018Swingle\u2019 citrumelo, the \u2018Argentina\u2019 citrange (AGC) and the \u2018Benecke\u2019 trifoliate orange (BKTO). Fruit setting rates of these crosses were measured and the hybrids generated were planted in the field in 2008 and evaluated from 2010 to 2014, for the variables of plant mortality, visual vigor, plant height and trunk diameter. The descriptive statistics mean, variation range, coefficient of variation and Pearson skewness coefficient were calculated. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and the means of the treatments were grouped by the Scott-Knott test, both at 5 % significance. The progenies, having the \u2018Sunki\u2019 mandarin as the female parent, presented higher fruit setting rates and lower plant mortality rates than those obtained from the female parent \u2018Rangpur\u2019 lime, while zero plant mortality was observed in the SFM \u00d7 BKTO cross.

In this respect, pollen grains were transferred in Petri dish containing culture medium and placed in a BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) chamber at 28 \u00baC for 60 h, being counted. The first evaluation was performed prior to the assembly of the experiment, testing the initial viability, whereas the second occurred 24 h after storage.

Creativity was evaluated using the following instruments: The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking-Figural Form B; and the Creative Personality Scale (EPC). Pearson correlations and multiple linear regressions consistently showed that Neuroticism related negatively to creativity while competence has a positive relation. The results suggested that more creative children presented less vulnerability, irritability and psychological distress, eventually becoming more independent, competent and emotionally self-regulated in coping with environmental demands. \nKey words: personality; creativity; big five; children\n"}, {"title": "Molecular characterization of rotaviruses isolated from calves with bovine neonatal diarrhea (BND) in Colombia", "url": "http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0123-93922018000200099&lang=en", "author": "Pardo-Mora, Dolly;                            Vargas-Berm\u00fadez, Diana S.;                            Oliver-Espinosa, Olimpo;                            Jaime-Correa, Jairo.

MA104 cell cultures were infected with positive samples in order to isolate rotaviruses. The presence of the viral genome was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of a region of the viral VP7 protein-encoding gene. \n\n\nResults:\n Of the 132 samples, 26 (19, 7%) were ELISA-positive and nine samples were used for viral isolation. PCR amplification was achieved in all infected cultures. Sequencing showed homology of five samples to the G6 genotype. In addition, the presence of the G10 genotype was first determined for the country. \n\n\nDiscussion:\n A greater presence of the G6 genotype from lineage V was found in the Sabana region of Bogota, showing a high prevalence in cattle and association with the presence of BND. The presence of the G10 genotype is a new report for the country and constitutes a new element of investigation in these viruses. \n\nKey words: Rotavirus; genotype; VP7; DNA sequencing\n"}, {"title": "Dimensionality and Determinants of Self-Reported Cognitive Failures", "url": "http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2011-20842018000100009&lang=en", "author": "Tirre, William C.

The first goal was to determine what factors, in addition to a general one, are needed to explain self-reported cognitive failures. To explore this issue, both Rasch measurement and confirmatory factor analysis were employed. The second goal was to determine if cognitive failures might be predicted with personality factors, general cognitive ability, and the need for cognition. A sample of 552 USAF airmen responded to the Broadbent Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), a Big-Five personality inventory, the Abstract Reasoning Test, the Speeded Cognitive Ability Test, and the Need for Cognition survey. Both Rasch modeling and confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a single factor dominated CFQ responses. Regression analysis showed that CFQ responses were predicted well by personality factors (R = .60).\nKey words: Cognitive failures; personality factors; cognitive ability\n"}, {"title": "Digestibility and pricing of Chlorella sorokiniana meal for use in tilapia feeds", "url": "http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-90162018000300184&lang=en", "author": "Barone, Rafael Sim\u00f5es Coelho;                            Sonoda, Daniel Yokoyama;                            Lorenz, Evandro Kleber;                            Cyrino, Jos\u00e9 Eurico Possebon.

In addition, high polyunsaturated fatty acid contents encourage their use in animal feeding and nutrition, particularly in the formulation and processing of aquafeeds. This study aims at estimating the feasibility of Chlorella meal as feed ingredient for the feeding and nutrition of farmed tilapia based upon digestibility data. Juvenile tilapia were stocked in conical-bottomed tanks (200 L) with superficial, continuous water flow, and fed to apparent satiation in three daily meals with a reference diet and a test diet containing 30 % lyophilized Chlorella sorokiniana added of an inert marker. Feces were collected overnight by sedimentation in refrigerated, plastic containers coupled to the tanks and analyzed for determination of chemical composition and inert marker contents to estimate apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of protein and energy of Chlorella meal; registered ADCs of Chlorella meal were 90.5 and 84.22, respectively. A pricing model considering the quantity of digestible nutrient was proposed based on ADCs of Chlorella and compared with the price of fishmeal (FM) and soybean meal (SBM). The indicative prices to elicit the use of Chlorella as a protein source rather than FM or SBM for the feed and nutrition of tilapia were 2.65 USD kg\u22121 and 0.66 USD kg\u22121, respectively.\nKeywords:\u00a0fish nutrition; microalgae; fishmeal; pricing model\n"}, {"title": "Ades\u00e3o ao regime terap\u00eautico medicamentoso e aspectos biopsicossociais dos idosos integrados em cuidados continuados domicili\u00e1rios", "url": "http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1983-14472017000300414&lang=en", "author": "Monterroso, L\u00edgia Eduarda Pereira;                            S\u00e1, Lu\u00eds Oct\u00e1vio de;                            Joaquim, Nat\u00e9rcia Maria Teixeira.

Twenty-six eight male Wistar rats were divided into two groups randomly. Potassium oxonate was used to establish hyperuricemic model for four weeks. In 2nd and 4th week, uric acid (UA) level, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), Gu,Zn-SOD activity and interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) concentration in serum were determined respectively. In 4th week, one hour after last PO treatment, five rats of every group were given Evans Blue to test blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Other brains were obtained to analysis T-SOD, Gu,Zn-SOD activity and IL-1\u03b2 concentration in cerebral system. Meanwhile, brain and kidney were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to observe pathological change. In 2nd week, both of T-SOD and Gu,Zn-SOD activity in serum increased obviously (P<0.05) in hyperuricemia rats. However, IL-1\u03b2 content didn\u2019t change remarkably. In the 4th week, T-SOD activity in model group had become similar with control group, and at the same time IL-1\u03b2 content in serum increased significantly (P<0.05). Pathological section showed the structural and functional unit of the kidney had been damaged. On the contrary, both of T-SOD and Gu,Zn-SOD activity in brain increased obviously (P<0.05), but IL-1\u03b2 concentration was no significant difference between two groups. In addition, the results of Evans Blue and H&E suggested the integrity of BBB and structure of brain were not changed after PO treatment. The permeability of BBB and form of UA would be potential factors to decide what kind role UA play on keeping balance between anti-oxidative stress and induction of inflammatory response.\nKeywords:\u00a0Hyperuricemic; Blood brain barrier; Potassium oxonate; Oxidative stress; Inflammatory; Total-SOD; Gu,Zn-SOD; IL-1\u03b2; Pathological injury\n"}]

In conventional citrus breeding programs, hybridization is the main method used for obtaining rootstock varieties. Between Sept and Oct 2006, controlled pollinations were carried out resulting in nine progenies, totaling 461 hybrid seedlings. The female parents were the \u2018Santa Cruz Rangpur\u2019 lime (SCRL) and the \u2018Sunki of Florida\u2019 mandarin (SFM), while the male parents, in addition to this mandarin, were the \u2018Indio\u2019 and \u2018Riverside\u2019 citrandarins, the \u2018Thomasville\u2019 citrangequat (THOM), the \u2018Swingle\u2019 citrumelo, the \u2018Argentina\u2019 citrange (AGC) and the \u2018Benecke\u2019 trifoliate orange (BKTO). Fruit setting rates of these crosses were measured and the hybrids generated were planted in the field in 2008 and evaluated from 2010 to 2014, for the variables of plant mortality, visual vigor, plant height and trunk diameter. The descriptive statistics mean, variation range, coefficient of variation and Pearson skewness coefficient were calculated. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and the means of the treatments were grouped by the Scott-Knott test, both at 5 % significance. The progenies, having the \u2018Sunki\u2019 mandarin as the female parent, presented higher fruit setting rates and lower plant mortality rates than those obtained from the female parent \u2018Rangpur\u2019 lime, while zero plant mortality was observed in the SFM \u00d7 BKTO cross. The crosses SCRL \u00d7 SFM, SFM \u00d7 BKTO, SFM \u00d7 AGC and SFM \u00d7 THOM have the potential to generate vigorous hybrids, resulting in rootstock varieties adapted to the landscape unit of Coastal Tableland.

Using several tests of stationarity that allow for the presence of breaks, we conclude that commodity prices are cointegrated with the current accounts in Latin American countries, suggesting that developmentalism plans did not obtain the desired productive diversification and that the region still relies heavily on commodities to determine its foreign position. Another important result supports the findings of Delbianco and Fioriti (2014, 2015) that the region had suffered two sudden stops in the last 60 years, bothdriven by shifts in commodity prices.

Air temperature data (\u00baC), relative humidity (%), and black globe humidity index (BGHI) data were collected throughout the day at 10-min intervals, with means compared by Tukey\u2019s test at 0.05 probability level. Instantaneous concentrations of ammonia (ppm), carbon dioxide (ppm), and sound pressure levels (dB(C)) were measured three times daily and analyzed on boxplot graphs. The results showed no difference between the two nurseries with respect to thermal, air, and acoustic environment. The nurseries can be considered uncomfortable for the animals with respect to thermal conditions. Concentrations of gases and sound pressure levels did not exceed the limits established by current regulations. In both nurseries only at 09h00 it was possible to detect sound pressure levels that characterize the condition of comfort thermal of the environment, at the other times, alert and stress conditions were observed.

The aim was to establish methodologies that increase the preservation of pollen viability and to establish the time to perform crossbreeds in hybridization studies with olive trees. Three experiments were performed with plants from the cultivar Arbequina, in Maria da F\u00e9, MG, Brazil. In the first experiment, the description of the flower events was performed. In the second, anthers were desiccated in eppendorfs, being stored at three different conditions for pollen viability test: room temperature (27 \u00baC), refrigerator (8 \u00baC) and freezer (-10 \u00baC). In order to evaluate the in vitro germination, culture medium for olive pollen grains was used. In this respect, pollen grains were transferred in Petri dish containing culture medium and placed in a BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) chamber at 28 \u00baC for 60 h, being counted. The first evaluation was performed prior to the assembly of the experiment, testing the initial viability, whereas the second occurred 24 h after storage. Subsequently, seven evaluations were performed fortnightly. In the third experiment, the stigma receptivity was verified by the 3% hydrogen peroxide method, with flowers in pre-anthesis, anthesis and post-anthesis, evaluated hourly in the period from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. for three days. In the description of the flower events, it was verified that the olive tree shows diurnal anthesis, with flower opening between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. The anthers stored in a freezer preserved the viability for 60 days and the stigmas were receptive since the pre-anthesis.

Four ileal digestion trials were carried out with 690 broilers, divided into the pre-starter, starter, growth and final phases. The birds were housed in metabolic cages and distributed in a completely randomised design, consisting of five treatments and six replications of eight, six, five and four birds respectively in each experimental phase. The treatments consisted of one reference feed and four test feeds, substituting 30% of the reference feed with four different yeasts. Yeasts two and four showed a higher percentage of amino acids. However, yeast two had the highest percentages of ADCDM, ADCCP and digestible protein: 83.64, 81.22 and 14.66% in the pre-starter phase; 78.09, 78.28 and 14.13% in the starter phase; 76.74, 74.75 and 13.49% in the growth phase; and 72.98, 71.21 and 12.85% in the final phase respectively.

A quasiexperimental design was used in which three groups of undergraduate students were trained in a virtual water maze to locate a hidden platform whose location was indicated by a set of cues. A pre-test without platform was performed prior to the training, and a post-test was conducted immediately after this (Group 0h), or after a retention interval of two (Group 48h) or seven days (Group 168h). For the pre-test, there was no evidence of preference for any area of the maze. Throughout the training trials, the time to find the goal decreased without differences between groups. During the post-test, all groups showed a preference for the reinforced quadrant, although the spent time, swimming distance, and accuracy of the search behavior in that area was equivalent between Group 0 h and Group 48 h, but higher than that shown by the Group 168 h. These data indicate changes in long-term spatial memory in humans, occurring after an interval of 48 h after its acquisition. The results are discussed on the basis of general memory processes and specific processes proposed by particular spatial memory theories. The clinical and comparative psychology implications are also addressed.

This study analyzes the relationship between MiL and PWB, as well as the differences in PWB according to the level of MiL (lack of meaning, indefinite meaning, and presence of meaning), in a sample of 333 Spanish emerging adults (224 women, 109 men), age ranged from 17 to 26 years, M = 21.06, SD = 2.23. Both Spanish versions of the Purpose-In-Life Test and the Ryff's Scales of Psychological Well-Being were used. The Spearman's coefficient of correlation showed a positive, significant relationship between MiL and PWB (global and dimensions). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences in PWB between lack of meaning, indefinite meaning, and presence of meaning groups, except in Autonomy, in which only the difference between the presence of meaning group and the indefinite meaning group was significant. MiL is associated to the cognitive, emotional, and motivational aspects that directly point to PWB: positive self-worth and self-acceptance, perception and experience of freedom, responsibility and self-determination, positive view of both life as a whole and future, purpose and commitment of significant existential goals, self-trascendence and opening up to the others, integrative but not resigned coping of the adversity, life satisfaction, and self-realization.

Two groups of all-ceramic crowns were produced according to the fabrication method of the infrastructure (IS) (n=30): IZC - IS produced by CAD-CAM; IZS - IS produced by slip-casting. The IS were veneered with porcelain and cemented to fiber-reinforced composite dies with resin cement. Crowns were loaded in compression to failure using a universal testing machine, at 1 mm/min crosshead speed and 37 \u00baC distilled water. Fractography was performed using stereomicroscope and SEM. Data were statistically analyzed with Student\u2019s t test (\u03b1=0.05) and Weibull analysis. There were no significant differences among the experimental groups for fracture load (p=0.481) and Weibull modulus. For both groups, the failure mode was catastrophic failure involving IS and porcelain.

This study aims at estimating the feasibility of Chlorella meal as feed ingredient for the feeding and nutrition of farmed tilapia based upon digestibility data. Juvenile tilapia were stocked in conical-bottomed tanks (200 L) with superficial, continuous water flow, and fed to apparent satiation in three daily meals with a reference diet and a test diet containing 30 % lyophilized Chlorella sorokiniana added of an inert marker. Feces were collected overnight by sedimentation in refrigerated, plastic containers coupled to the tanks and analyzed for determination of chemical composition and inert marker contents to estimate apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of protein and energy of Chlorella meal; registered ADCs of Chlorella meal were 90.5 and 84.22, respectively. A pricing model considering the quantity of digestible nutrient was proposed based on ADCs of Chlorella and compared with the price of fishmeal (FM) and soybean meal (SBM).

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study with an analytical component, with a sample of 452 children hospitalized with pneumonia at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira, between 2010 and 2013. The inclusion criterion was children aged from one month to less than five years of age with proof in the immunization record. The exclusion criterion was the presence of hospital-acquired pneumonia or concomitant disease. We have evaluated the adequacy of the immunization schedule for the BCG, tetravalent, MMR, and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV-10) vaccines. We used the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test followed by multivariate Poisson regression, estimating the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios and respective 95% confidence intervals. The variables with p < 0.20 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis.  RESULTS: There was good adequacy in the immunization schedule, except for PCV-10, which presented a percentage lower than 85%. We have observed an association between adequate compliance with the immunization schedule and education level of the mother (89.9% complete high school), sex of the child (87.2% female), age of the child (94.2% younger than six months), and breastfeeding (84.3% breastfed).  CONCLUSIONS: Given the high rate of education level of the mother and the high percentage of breastfeeding, we can understand that there is a better understanding of the health of the child by the mothers studied in this study, showing the effectiveness of public policies for infant feeding. However, children did not have good adequacy of the immunization schedule of PCV-10, one of the main vaccines against pneumonia, which can be one of the main factors in the causes of hospitalization, with no influence on the classification of the severity of the disease. In this way, we emphasize that the causes of pneumonia morbidity are not associated with a single factor.

Twenty-six eight male Wistar rats were divided into two groups randomly. Potassium oxonate was used to establish hyperuricemic model for four weeks. In 2nd and 4th week, uric acid (UA) level, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), Gu,Zn-SOD activity and interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) concentration in serum were determined respectively. In 4th week, one hour after last PO treatment, five rats of every group were given Evans Blue to test blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Other brains were obtained to analysis T-SOD, Gu,Zn-SOD activity and IL-1\u03b2 concentration in cerebral system. Meanwhile, brain and kidney were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to observe pathological change. In 2nd week, both of T-SOD and Gu,Zn-SOD activity in serum increased obviously (P<0.05) in hyperuricemia rats. However, IL-1\u03b2 content didn\u2019t change remarkably. In the 4th week, T-SOD activity in model group had become similar with control group, and at the same time IL-1\u03b2 content in serum increased significantly (P<0.05). Pathological section showed the structural and functional unit of the kidney had been damaged. On the contrary, both of T-SOD and Gu,Zn-SOD activity in brain increased obviously (P<0.05), but IL-1\u03b2 concentration was no significant difference between two groups. In addition, the results of Evans Blue and H&E suggested the integrity of BBB and structure of brain were not changed after PO treatment. The permeability of BBB and form of UA would be potential factors to decide what kind role UA play on keeping balance between anti-oxidative stress and induction of inflammatory response.

", "description": "            Abstract  Background: Sudden cardiac death is the most frequent death mechanism in Chagas disease, responsible for 55% to 65% of the deaths of patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). The most often involved electrophysiological mechanisms are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has a beneficial role in preventing sudden death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and, thus the correct identification of patients at risk is required. The association of microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) with the appearance of ventricular arrhythmias has been assessed in different heart diseases. The role of MTWA is mostly unknown in patients with CCC.  Objectives: To evaluate the association between MTWA and the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with CCC.  Method: This is a case-control study including patients with CCC and ICD, with history of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (case group), and patients with CCC and no history of those arrhythmias (control group). The MTWA test results were classified as negative and non-negative (positive and indeterminate). The significance level adopted was a = 0.05.  Results: We recruited 96 patients, 45 cases (46.8%) and 51 controls (53.1%). The MTWA test was non-negative in 36/45 cases (80%) and 15/51 controls (29.4%) [OR = 9.60 (95%CI: 3.41 - 27.93)]. After adjustment for known confounding factors in a logistic regression model, the non-negative result continued to be associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias [OR = 5.17 (95%CI: 1.05 - 25.51)].  Conclusion: Patients with CCC and history of malignant ventricular arrhythmias more often have a non-negative MTWA test as compared to patients with no history of arrhythmia.

Articles published in the period from 2010 to 2014, of the observational epidemiological type, in Portuguese, English and Spanish, were included. Articles that did not have abstracts or that were review articles, theses, dissertations, and editorials were excluded. We adopted the relative risk and their respective confidence intervals (95%CI) as measures of effect, obtained through the random effect model and represented by the forest plot type graph. The Egger test and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, respectively, were used to analyze possible publication biases and the quality of the studies.  RESULTS  Of the 926 articles identified, 17 were eligible for the study. Of the 17 full texts published, seven were retrospective cohort studies, nine were cross-sectional studies, and one was a case-control study. Except for one study, the others reported a positive association between race/color of skin and prematurity. Compared with full-term newborns, the relative risk of the combined effect in those born preterm was 1.51 (95%CI 1.39-1.69). The funnel chart suggested publication bias.  CONCLUSIONS  The present meta-analysis indicated a positive association for the risk of prematurity according to race/skin color.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the thermotherapy in the control of anthracnose in \u2018Prata An\u00e3\u2019 banana produced in northern state of Minas Gerais. Bananas \u2018Prata An\u00e3\u2019 variety were divided into groups of three fruits and inoculated with Colletotrichum musae. Groups were submitted to thermotherapy using five temperatures (40\u00b0C, 44\u00b0C, 48\u00b0C, 52\u00b0C and 56\u00b0C) and four immersion times (4, 8, 12 and 16 minutes) and control. Treatments were repeated five times in a completely randomized design. Area under the incidence progress curve (AUIPC) and area under the severity progress curve (AUSPC) were calculated. To evaluate the thermotherapy efficiency compared to chemical control, fruits were submitted to the following treatments: thermotherapy with and without fungicide application and fruits treated with fungicide only, the control fruits without thermotherapy and without fungicide application. After fifteen days of storage, fruits were evaluated for anthracnose severity. The results of experiments were submitted to analysis of variance and regression and means were compared by the Scott-Knott test (p<0.05). Control was compared to treatments by the Dunnett test (p<0,05). The lowest anthracnose AUIPC values were observed when using temperature of 48\u00b0C for eight and 12 minutes. Thermotherapy at 52\u00b0C from eight minutes of immersion, in addition to reducing the anthracnose AUSPC in fruits up to 81.6%, delayed maturation of fruits. Fruits submitted to thermotherapy at 56\u00b0C presented higher severity of the disease and resulted in the maturation of fruits. Thermotherapy reduces anthracnose severity in fruits in a manner similar to fungicide use, but the association of both results in better control of the disease in \u2018Prata An\u00e3\u2019 banana. Thermotherapy is an efficient technique to reduce the severity of the disease in \u2018Prata An\u00e3\u2019 banana produced in northern state of Minas Gerais.        "}]

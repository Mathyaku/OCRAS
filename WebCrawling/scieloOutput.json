In conventional citrus breeding programs, hybridization is the main method used for obtaining rootstock varieties. Between Sept and Oct 2006, controlled pollinations were carried out resulting in nine progenies, totaling 461 hybrid seedlings. The female parents were the \u2018Santa Cruz Rangpur\u2019 lime (SCRL) and the \u2018Sunki of Florida\u2019 mandarin (SFM), while the male parents, in addition to this mandarin, were the \u2018Indio\u2019 and \u2018Riverside\u2019 citrandarins, the \u2018Thomasville\u2019 citrangequat (THOM), the \u2018Swingle\u2019 citrumelo, the \u2018Argentina\u2019 citrange (AGC) and the \u2018Benecke\u2019 trifoliate orange (BKTO). Fruit setting rates of these crosses were measured and the hybrids generated were planted in the field in 2008 and evaluated from 2010 to 2014, for the variables of plant mortality, visual vigor, plant height and trunk diameter. The descriptive statistics mean, variation range, coefficient of variation and Pearson skewness coefficient were calculated. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and the means of the treatments were grouped by the Scott-Knott test, both at 5 % significance. The progenies, having the \u2018Sunki\u2019 mandarin as the female parent, presented higher fruit setting rates and lower plant mortality rates than those obtained from the female parent \u2018Rangpur\u2019 lime, while zero plant mortality was observed in the SFM \u00d7 BKTO cross.

Four ileal digestion trials were carried out with 690 broilers, divided into the pre-starter, starter, growth and final phases. The birds were housed in metabolic cages and distributed in a completely randomised design, consisting of five treatments and six replications of eight, six, five and four birds respectively in each experimental phase. The treatments consisted of one reference feed and four test feeds, substituting 30% of the reference feed with four different yeasts. Yeasts two and four showed a higher percentage of amino acids. However, yeast two had the highest percentages of ADCDM, ADCCP and digestible protein: 83.64, 81.22 and 14.66% in the pre-starter phase; 78.09, 78.28 and 14.13% in the starter phase; 76.74, 74.75 and 13.49% in the growth phase; and 72.98, 71.21 and 12.85% in the final phase respectively.

A quasiexperimental design was used in which three groups of undergraduate students were trained in a virtual water maze to locate a hidden platform whose location was indicated by a set of cues. A pre-test without platform was performed prior to the training, and a post-test was conducted immediately after this (Group 0h), or after a retention interval of two (Group 48h) or seven days (Group 168h). For the pre-test, there was no evidence of preference for any area of the maze. Throughout the training trials, the time to find the goal decreased without differences between groups. During the post-test, all groups showed a preference for the reinforced quadrant, although the spent time, swimming distance, and accuracy of the search behavior in that area was equivalent between Group 0 h and Group 48 h, but higher than that shown by the Group 168 h. These data indicate changes in long-term spatial memory in humans, occurring after an interval of 48 h after its acquisition. The results are discussed on the basis of general memory processes and specific processes proposed by particular spatial memory theories. The clinical and comparative psychology implications are also addressed.

This study analyzes the relationship between MiL and PWB, as well as the differences in PWB according to the level of MiL (lack of meaning, indefinite meaning, and presence of meaning), in a sample of 333 Spanish emerging adults (224 women, 109 men), age ranged from 17 to 26 years, M = 21.06, SD = 2.23. Both Spanish versions of the Purpose-In-Life Test and the Ryff's Scales of Psychological Well-Being were used. The Spearman's coefficient of correlation showed a positive, significant relationship between MiL and PWB (global and dimensions). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences in PWB between lack of meaning, indefinite meaning, and presence of meaning groups, except in Autonomy, in which only the difference between the presence of meaning group and the indefinite meaning group was significant. MiL is associated to the cognitive, emotional, and motivational aspects that directly point to PWB: positive self-worth and self-acceptance, perception and experience of freedom, responsibility and self-determination, positive view of both life as a whole and future, purpose and commitment of significant existential goals, self-trascendence and opening up to the others, integrative but not resigned coping of the adversity, life satisfaction, and self-realization.

The proportion of correct attempts was analyzed, and was found to be higher in the ITrial and RTrial groups for the training phase, and for the PStart, PTrial and RTrial groups in the extra-instance and extra-modal transfer test, as well as for the ITrial group in the extra-relational test; the larger number of accurate performance descriptions was observed in the RTrial group. These results show that abstract stimulus control can be presented either by way of transfer of functions throughout instructions, or by differentiation of positive and negative cases of the contingencies, which is enhanced by the concurrent presence of the instruction and the stimulus array.

Two groups of all-ceramic crowns were produced according to the fabrication method of the infrastructure (IS) (n=30): IZC - IS produced by CAD-CAM; IZS - IS produced by slip-casting. The IS were veneered with porcelain and cemented to fiber-reinforced composite dies with resin cement. Crowns were loaded in compression to failure using a universal testing machine, at 1 mm/min crosshead speed and 37 \u00baC distilled water. Fractography was performed using stereomicroscope and SEM. Data were statistically analyzed with Student\u2019s t test (\u03b1=0.05) and Weibull analysis. There were no significant differences among the experimental groups for fracture load (p=0.481) and Weibull modulus. For both groups, the failure mode was catastrophic failure involving IS and porcelain. It was concluded that the fabrication methods evaluated resulted in all-ceramic crowns with similar fracture behavior and reliability.

Four ileal digestion trials were carried out with 690 broilers, divided into the pre-starter, starter, growth and final phases. The birds were housed in metabolic cages and distributed in a completely randomised design, consisting of five treatments and six replications of eight, six, five and four birds respectively in each experimental phase. The treatments consisted of one reference feed and four test feeds, substituting 30% of the reference feed with four different yeasts. Yeasts two and four showed a higher percentage of amino acids. However, yeast two had the highest percentages of ADCDM, ADCCP and digestible protein: 83.64, 81.22 and 14.66% in the pre-starter phase; 78.09, 78.28 and 14.13% in the starter phase; 76.74, 74.75 and 13.49% in the growth phase; and 72.98, 71.21 and 12.85% in the final phase respectively. There was an average reduction of 0.424% in ADCDM and 0.428% in ADCCP for each day the birds aged. The following prediction equations were generated from the composition of the yeasts and age of the chickens: ADCDM = 77.4 - 0.424*(age) - 7.51*(DM) - 45.01*(EE) and - 0.424*(age) + 3.02*(CP) + 126.93*(EE) - 0.03*(GMD) and ADCCP = 606.9-0.428*(age) -5.8*(DM) - 0.01*(GMD) and -0.426*(age) + 2.68(CP) + 139.7*(EE) - 0.03*(GMD).

A quasiexperimental design was used in which three groups of undergraduate students were trained in a virtual water maze to locate a hidden platform whose location was indicated by a set of cues. A pre-test without platform was performed prior to the training, and a post-test was conducted immediately after this (Group 0h), or after a retention interval of two (Group 48h) or seven days (Group 168h). For the pre-test, there was no evidence of preference for any area of the maze. Throughout the training trials, the time to find the goal decreased without differences between groups. During the post-test, all groups showed a preference for the reinforced quadrant, although the spent time, swimming distance, and accuracy of the search behavior in that area was equivalent between Group 0 h and Group 48 h, but higher than that shown by the Group 168 h. These data indicate changes in long-term spatial memory in humans, occurring after an interval of 48 h after its acquisition. The results are discussed on the basis of general memory processes and specific processes proposed by particular spatial memory theories. The clinical and comparative psychology implications are also addressed.

This study analyzes the relationship between MiL and PWB, as well as the differences in PWB according to the level of MiL (lack of meaning, indefinite meaning, and presence of meaning), in a sample of 333 Spanish emerging adults (224 women, 109 men), age ranged from 17 to 26 years, M = 21.06, SD = 2.23. Both Spanish versions of the Purpose-In-Life Test and the Ryff's Scales of Psychological Well-Being were used. The Spearman's coefficient of correlation showed a positive, significant relationship between MiL and PWB (global and dimensions). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences in PWB between lack of meaning, indefinite meaning, and presence of meaning groups, except in Autonomy, in which only the difference between the presence of meaning group and the indefinite meaning group was significant. MiL is associated to the cognitive, emotional, and motivational aspects that directly point to PWB: positive self-worth and self-acceptance, perception and experience of freedom, responsibility and self-determination, positive view of both life as a whole and future, purpose and commitment of significant existential goals, self-trascendence and opening up to the others, integrative but not resigned coping of the adversity, life satisfaction, and self-realization.

Twenty undergraduate students were assigned to one of four experimental groups: (a) procedural instruction at the start of the task (PStart); (b) procedural instruction in each trial (PTrial); (c) instruction referring to instances in each trial (ITrial); and (d) instruction referring to relation in each trial (RTrial). The proportion of correct attempts was analyzed, and was found to be higher in the ITrial and RTrial groups for the training phase, and for the PStart, PTrial and RTrial groups in the extra-instance and extra-modal transfer test, as well as for the ITrial group in the extra-relational test; the larger number of accurate performance descriptions was observed in the RTrial group. These results show that abstract stimulus control can be presented either by way of transfer of functions throughout instructions, or by differentiation of positive and negative cases of the contingencies, which is enhanced by the concurrent presence of the instruction and the stimulus array.

The raw materials were mixed for 6 h and the mixture was melted at 1550 \u00b0C and then water quenched. The glass produced was milled for 5 h to obtain fine powder, which was used to prepare porous cordierite through gel casting method. The effect of addition of different natural binders, glutinous rice flour (GRF) and dried egg white (DEW), on porous cordierite was investigated. GRF and DEW were added to the slurry during mixing. The synthesized cordierite powder was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Porous cordierite was characterized through Archimedes method, morphological analysis, and compression test. The porosity level varied from 60.6% to 78.7% depending on the amount of natural binder added. Compression test results showed that the compressive strength of porous cordierite increased with increasing amount of natural binder added.

Each processing step may introduce flaws to the material, which compromises its properties and reliability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fabrication method on the fracture behavior of prosthetic crowns produced with an alumina-based glass-infiltrated zirconia-reinforced ceramic. Two groups of all-ceramic crowns were produced according to the fabrication method of the infrastructure (IS) (n=30): IZC - IS produced by CAD-CAM; IZS - IS produced by slip-casting. The IS were veneered with porcelain and cemented to fiber-reinforced composite dies with resin cement. Crowns were loaded in compression to failure using a universal testing machine, at 1 mm/min crosshead speed and 37 \u00baC distilled water. Fractography was performed using stereomicroscope and SEM. Data were statistically analyzed with Student\u2019s t test (\u03b1=0.05) and Weibull analysis. There were no significant differences among the experimental groups for fracture load (p=0.481) and Weibull modulus. For both groups, the failure mode was catastrophic failure involving IS and porcelain. It was concluded that the fabrication methods evaluated resulted in all-ceramic crowns with similar fracture behavior and reliability.        "}]
